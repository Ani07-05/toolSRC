SCHOLARLY SOPHISTICATION:
- Reference 40-60 peer-reviewed sources across multiple disciplines
- Include recent publications (last 5 years) alongside seminal works
- Cover literature from leading journals (Food Policy, Agricultural Economics, World Development)
- Include international perspectives and cross-cultural studies
- Reference working papers and policy documents from authoritative sources

Write a literature review that would meet the highest standards of top-tier journals in agricultural economics and development studies (American Journal of Agricultural Economics, Food Policy, World Development, Journal of Development Economics), demonstrating comprehensive knowledge of the field, sophisticated theoretical understanding, and critical analytical thinking. The review should position the current research as addressing significant gaps while building on established foundations.
